CLAUDE.md  

we are currently expanding tasks from FINAL_PASS_TASK_REMEDIATION. the flow is to claim a task by
replacing the [ ] with an hourglass emoji, replace the line instructions that tell you to read the instructions at
the top of the file, teh prompt to expand the task, and teh claude.md file to refresh them in context (and do so,
don't just remove the instructions and ignore them; you removing them is acknowledging that you see them and are
doing as it says). mark it as in progress, then begin expansion as described in those files. you were working on
task-013  but the window ran out of context and wouldn't compact for some reason, so i am starting a new fresh
context window here to resume.  so pick up all of task suite 013, and start at the beginning just to be sure it's
all done right wiht a fresh context of the requirements; remember that presence of a section, or linecount, is not
an indication of completion. we could have a description with 300 lines of lorem ipsum, but that doesn't mean we
skip and move on. that is semantically useless, so should be caught and replaced with adequate relevant semantically
 complete text according to our standards.
