your next task is to review docs\TDD_INSTRUCTIONS.md and claude.md, then read every part of every one of these files

{
docs\tasks\refined-tasks\Epic 02\epic-02-cli-agent-orchestration-core.md

docs\tasks\refined-tasks\Epic 02\task-010-cli-command-framework.md

}. keep in mind that You MUST follow strict Test-Driven Development with no exceptions. when you have a comprehensive, complete understanding of the task suite, come up with a strategic, phase-based implementation plan to implement the entirety of task suite

{
010
},

the whole task, including ALL PARTS of the parent task and EACH ONE OF ITS subtasks. the task is not done if any of the subtasks are not done, as per CLAUDE.md. in the implementation plan, include auditing and ensuring that the ENTIRE SUITE is implemented as per the critical guidelines in claude.md regarding definition of done.

put the implementation plan in writing as instructed in claude.md, create a new feature branch for it, and begin implementation.

 be sure to commit as each subtask is completed, if not more often at your discretion. work autonomously until feature is complete or you are under 5k tokens remaining for context. it is preferable that you do not monitor or change behavior on account of tokens at all, and instead work through them all until you run out and are forced to stop. that is why it is important to keep the implementation plan updated as you proceed, so we can pick up and resume seamlessly. remember to audit when you think you are done following docs\AUDIT-GUIDELINES.md and claude.md guidelines, and remember that you are not to decide to defer anything that is in these tasks. remember, and this is critically important -- there is NOTHING that is optional. it is all in scope, if it is in these documents. if it is not possible to complete due to down-the-line dependencies, then the task doesn't belong where it is, and raise the issue with me and we will move the task / subtask to where it belongs, as per the instructions in Claude.md.
