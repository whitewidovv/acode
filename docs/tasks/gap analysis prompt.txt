 great thats merged. fetch latest and were going to continue
  implementation and gap
    analysis.  moving on to 005c within 005 suite. another agent is
  simultaneously implementing 
  
  005a&b

  so if there is anything here dependent upon
  them, you have explicit permission to defer it to the end of this implementation task, but only the pieces that require stuff from those in  progress. the
  rest still goes through normal deferal requirements. i'll have you merge
  in the preceeding tasks when done and gap free, but i feel there's work that can be
  done on this one in the mean time.  here's the typical implementation
    prompt to help guide you on beginning: you're window 3 on account of operating out of worktrees/3 diretory. we're going through the task list that should be implemented and figuring out what was missed. we're going to start at task 005c now and confirm
  implementation according to spec.  it's necessary because we've
  identified many gaps in other files that the implementing agent claimed
  were fully implemented and passed an audit.  so we're continuing on to 005, and you are now on 005c,  working methodically through. implement it as per CLAUDE.md (read CLAUDE.md thoroughly and follow it precisely)
  instructions. pull latest from main, create a feature branch from it, and begin. remember that 
  presence alone does not equal implemented, only semantic completion
  does, and your checklist should contain all gaps (things that should have been implemented but are confirmed to either NOT be implemented, be implemented wrong, or incompletely according to specs and possibly evolved requirements) in implementation order, specifically for task assigned to you.
