# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE TO COMPLETE THIS EPIC SUMMARY (REFINED SPEC TARGET)

You are expanding an **epic stub** into a complete EPIC specification for **Agentic Coding Bot (Acode)**.

Quality bar:
- This EPIC doc must make it easy to implement every task in the epic.
- It must define boundaries, shared interfaces, and cross-cutting constraints.

## Required Sections
1) Epic Overview (purpose, boundaries, dependencies)
2) Outcomes (10–25)
3) Non-Goals (10–25)
4) Architecture & Integration Points (interfaces, events, data contracts)
5) Operational Considerations (modes/safety/audit)
6) Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done (50–120 checkboxes)
7) Risks & Mitigations (12+)
8) Milestone Plan (3–7 milestones mapping to tasks)
9) “Definition of Epic Complete” checklist (20–40)
