create a new feature branch for 

task-number 

gap fixing.   

docs/implementation-plans/task-number-completion-checklist.md -- we created that document, a comprehensive, self-contained
  implementation checklist that guided completion of task-number to 100% specification compliance. we created it by going through the docs\GAP_ANALYSIS_METHODOLOGY.md and docs\tasks\implement assigned task prompt.md and
  looking specifically at the "Implementation Prompt" and Testing Requirements sections at the bottom of the 

task-number

  task file, and also looking at the Acceptance Criteria, the Functional Requirements, and description, for the subtask and its parent, documenting absolutely everything that still
  needs to be done (gaps) before writing any code, and documenting it to such a high degree that a clean slate claude agent could pick up the 
  
  task-number-completion-checklist.md 
  
  file you're going to create, read the instructions you're going to add to the top based on the instructions in
  
  task-number-completion-checklist 
  
  linked above.  that clean slate agent can pick up the document, read it, and get started implementing things one by one checking them off in order from the checklist you're going to create, going down the
  checklist, and when they are done, the entire feature will be implemented. 

  (parent, path-to-parent.md, for reference,
  and task-number, path-to-subtask.md).

  when you have that document created, and every thing that needs to be done to reach 100% completion is documented to such a degree that each individual item has enough information and instruction to find where it comes from in the documentation, and what you should do to implement it, clear enough that the clean-context claude agent would not be confused as to what you're talking about and could easily implement it... when you have that document created, check back in with me.
