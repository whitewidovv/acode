# Final Pass Task Remediation - Comprehensive Quality Expansion

## Instructions

**Before beginning ANY expansion:**

1. **Re-read `CLAUDE.md`** - Refresh the full context of quality requirements
2. **Re-read `PROMPT_TO_EXPAND_TASK.md`** - Refresh the expansion methodology  
3. **Re-read `e-commerce golden standard task sample.md`** - This is the quality bar (3,699 lines)

**Expansion Process:**

1. Read the current task file completely
2. Evaluate each section against the golden standard
3. Expand section-by-section, saving after each section to avoid context loss
4. A section is NOT complete just because it exists - it must be semantically complete
5. The test: Could an inept junior developer implement this by following the instructions alone, with no questions asked and no Googling required?

**Quality Bar (Non-Negotiable):**

- **Description**: 300+ lines with business value, ROI justification, technical architecture decisions, integration points, constraints - all with specific numbers
- **Use Cases**: 3+ scenarios, each 10-15 lines minimum with named personas, before/after comparisons, concrete metrics
- **User Manual**: 200-400 lines with step-by-step instructions, ASCII mockups, configuration tables, best practices, troubleshooting, FAQ
- **Assumptions**: 15-20 items covering technical, operational, and integration assumptions
- **Security Considerations**: Threat analysis, mitigation strategies, audit requirements specific to this feature
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 50-80+ testable items with specific benchmarks (exact ms, exact percentages, exact counts)
- **Best Practices**: 12+ items organized by category
- **Troubleshooting**: 3+ common issues with Symptoms/Causes/Solutions format
- **Testing Requirements**: Complete test names for Unit (5-8+), Integration (3-5+), E2E (3-5+), Performance (3-4+), Regression (2-3+)
- **User Verification**: 8-10 manual testing scenarios with step-by-step instructions
- **Implementation Prompt**: 12+ implementation steps with complete code examples (not snippets), 400-600 lines

**DO NOT check the box unless:**

- [ ] All sections are semantically complete (not just present)
- [ ] Line count is 1,200+ for subtasks, 1,500+ for parent tasks (this is a FLOOR, not a target)
- [ ] No abbreviations, placeholders, "see above", "etc.", or "..." anywhere
- [ ] A junior developer could implement from this document alone
- [ ] Matches quality depth of the e-commerce golden standard sample

## Quality Reminders

### What "Complete" Looks Like

From the e-commerce golden standard (Task 044 - Subscription/Recurring Orders):

- **3,699 lines** of comprehensive documentation
- **Description** explains business value with specific revenue projections ($88k ARR), customer LTV comparisons (3.2× higher), churn metrics (8-12% monthly)
- **Use Cases** have 3 fully-written scenarios with named personas (Sarah, Alex, Jordan), before/after workflows with specific numbers
- **User Manual** includes ASCII mockups of every screen, step-by-step instructions, pricing tables, billing frequency options
- **Implementation Prompt** contains complete C# code for entities, services, controllers, Blazor components - not snippets

### What "Incomplete" Looks Like

- Sections that exist but contain only 10-20 lines of generic content
- Acceptance criteria like "System should work correctly" (not testable)
- Testing requirements that say "Write appropriate tests" (not specific)
- Implementation prompts with "// ... rest of implementation" (incomplete)
- Missing Security Considerations section entirely
- Best Practices with 4 generic items instead of 12+ specific ones

### The Junior Developer Test

Before marking complete, ask:

1. Could someone with 6 months of C# experience implement this?
2. Would they need to ask ANY clarifying questions?
3. Would they need to Google how to do anything?
4. Are all edge cases documented?
5. Are all error scenarios described?
6. Is every configuration option listed with all possible values?

If ANY answer is "no" - the task is NOT complete.
